Paper 19:

Lets say in an experiment we are identifying spring vibrations which oscillates at a frequency of 4 hz. Which of the follwoing is True with respect to this case?

options

a) We need to construct an ideal bandpass filter which filters frequencies 3-5 hz.
b) We need to construct an ideal bandpass filter which filters frequencies 0-10 hz.
c) Spatial filtering can be used to reduce noise within the video. 
d) This method fails when there are high displacements of the spring.

Answer

option b


Paper 20:

Which of the following is NOT True?


options

a) The major drawback of Coarse to fine schemes is that the errors at coarser levels propagate across scales and thus leading to unreliable esimations.
b) The image edges can be assumed to be a subset of motion boundaries.
c) Geodesic distance calculation is preferred over euclidean distance calculation as the former has high computational costs. 
d) The output of the sparse to dense interpolation is used as initialization for variational energy minimization method.


Answer
option c
